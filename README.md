# Phoenix, AZ Changes in Biodiversity Intactness Index: 2017-2020

## About
This repository contains a notebook `phoenix_bii_changes.ipynb` analyzing data about Biodiversity Intactness Index(BII) in Phoenix Subdivision, Arizona from 2017-2020.   

## Visualization
After examining geospatial datasets I created a classified raster map showing the area with BII>=0.75 in 2017 that was lost by 2020. This map is located in the images/ directory.

## Highlights
- Raster wrangling with `rioxarray`
- Creating and customizing a raster plot
